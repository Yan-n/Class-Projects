 This project is to run in Eclipse
 
 After you run the main class, you will see several buttons named different types of fireworks and several sliders to choose parameters.
 You can drag these sliders and then choose a color you want before launch a kind of firework (if you choose a small speed, very big 
 time delayed, or very samll angle, the firework might be outside of canvas. For most values, it will be in the canvas.) 
 
 After that, you click on one button and you are expected to see the firework. For the snowflake type, you can click the buttons for 
 several times to see different lengths of the snowflake(randomness.)
 
 Extra credit 3: for "line explosion," you'll see some smaller fireworks which are broken from the original big ones. The smaller parts
 follow a trajectory with the same initial speed(v0) and new time delayed which is proportional to the previous one. The angles are a
 little different from the previous one with a fixed pattern.
