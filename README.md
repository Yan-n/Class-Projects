# Class-Projects


These small projects are some of the games I've written for my programming course at school.
The first two are written in java.
The first one is to launch fireworks according player's presetted parameters and chosen shape. 
The second one is a small video game that player has to land the rocket on the red line with a speed as small as possible.
The third one is written in R studio which analyzes selected data from a past European Social Survey.
