 This project is to run in Eclipse
 
You need five keys to play this game.
space key: to start a run
Up key: to increase the velocity according to the direction of the rocket
Left key: rotate the rocket to the left
Right key: rotate the rocket to the right
Enter/Return key: to reset the game after each run

So firstly you press the space key to start, and immediately press the up key to prevent the rocket from dropping. 
Then you combine the right and left key to make the rocket go to the direction of the landing area (the red rectangle)
You should avoid pressing Up key too many times because the rocket will crash if the velocity landing is too large
You should also pay attention the grey circle on the top right corner, which shows the fuel left.
After you finished the third run, your score will be shown on the window. Then pressing the keys will exit the program.

Information about the code:
Each run becomes harder with less fuel.

For extra credit1, there is a randomly appearing cloud every run. If the rocket hits that, it will crash.
For extra credit2, there is a moving fuel every run. If the rocket hits that, the score will plus one and the fuel vanishes.
